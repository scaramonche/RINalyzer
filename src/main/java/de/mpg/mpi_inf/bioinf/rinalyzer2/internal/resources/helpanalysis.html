      <b>Settings for the centrality analysis performed by RINalyzer </b>
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Choose attribute as edge weight:</b><br>This setting allows you 
          to define edge weights for the network to be analyzed among all numeric
          edge attributes stored in the current Cytoscape session. The default 
          option is <i>None</i> and stands for no specific weight attribute. In 
	  this case all edges are assigned the value of default edge weight. Note
	  that weights equal to zero will be ignored during the computation, i.e. 
 	  edges with weight equal to 0 will be ignored.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Handle multiple edges:</b><br>RINs have multiple edges. However, 
	  these have to be eliminated for the computation of centrality measures. 
	  You can achieve this by either selecting only one edge type or the option
	  <i>Mean weight</i>. The first case is very suitable for a network 
	  that has an edge type with an overall weight being a combination of 
	  the weights of the multiple edge types. If this is not the case, then you 
	  can use the mean weight, which is the mean over the weights of the 
	  multiple edges for each pair of directly connected nodes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Handle negative weights:</b><br>Since the RINalyzer centralities 
          are defined only for non negative weights, negative weights have to 
          be removed before computation. This could be done either by ignoring 
          (option <i>Ignore</i>) them or by reverting them by their absolute 
		  value (option <i>Revert</i>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Convert scores into distances:</b><br>Shortest path 
	  centrality measures are computed with the assumption that the weights 
	  represent distances, i.e. the smaller the weight, the stronger the 
	  interaction. However, if your network has similarity weights, you 
	  can select to convert them into distances by either inverting them 
	  (<i>1/value</i>) or by subtracting each value from a maximal value 
	  (<i>max - value</i>). Note that if your edge weights are equal to 
	  zero, they will not be inverted. The maximum is the biggest weight 
	  value increased by one, in order to avoid weights equal to zero after 
	  the subtraction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Default edge weight (if missing):</b><br>This value is used as 
          default weight when there are missing weight attribute values. For 
	  example, if there is no weight attribute, i.e. you selected the 
	  option <i>None</i>, the default edge weight is assigned to 
	  all edges. If additionally the default value is 1, the network is 
	  treated as unweighted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Cutoff for shortest path degree:</b><br>Weighted shortest path
          degree counts all neighbors of a node that are at distance smaller
	  or equal a cutoff. Note that you should choose this value suitable
          to your edge weights.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>For betweenness computation exclude paths between nodes within 
          the same set(s)</b><br> This option is enabled when the subnetwork
          of the nodes selected for the analysis is disconnected. In such 
          case you may want to see the betweenness values computed only in 
          respect to pairs of nodes that are connected by paths containing 
          nodes that are not selected.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>For the computation of the centrality measures we assume that the network</b></p>
    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>
        <p> is undirected, </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> is connected, </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> has no loops, </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> is weighted, and </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> can have multiple edges.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, we cannot guarantee meaningful results in case the mentioned assumptions do not hold for the analyzed network.</p>
